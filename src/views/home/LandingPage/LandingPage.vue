            With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the Eterna project harnessed online
            gamers toward a solution the OpenVaccine challenge. Their mission? To develop mRNA vaccines
            stable enough to be deployed to everyone in the world and not just a privileged few. By the
            end of 2020, we did it! Check out this <router-link to="/news/10799462">announcement</router-link> and

            This year we celebrate 10 years of citizen science through Eterna. Together we've
            synthesized thousands of player-designed molecules, published over 20 academic papers
            tackling fundamental RNA design questions, and pioneered the open development of RNA
            medicines. Over the course of the year we'll be rolling out new features and game
            mechanics as we continue to build the future of Eterna.

              Our current goal is to design refrigerator-stable mRNA vaccines that would accelerate
              COVID-19 immunization to all communities. The winning solutions could come from
              anywhere in the world, from anyone who possesses a gift for puzzles.

              For OpenVaccine and all other current and future challenges, Eterna is therefore
              committed to cultivating a diverse playerbase both to find solutions that have eluded
              experts and to ethically set the research priorities of its worldwide projects.

            <p style="font-size: 16px;">
              Soon Eterna will be playable on mobile phones, making our reach global and more
              accessible to players without laptop/desktop devices. Eterna is accelerating several
              new programs and partnerships that aim to increase accessibility in all senses and to
              increase participation in and leadership within Eterna from disadvantaged groups. We
              strive to be the scientific discovery game of the people.
